### How to play the game:
Run the main.py file, and it will automatically start the snake game. 
The user uses the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move the snake. The snake is initially 3 block size and gets 
a block size bigger everytime it eats a blue circle snack.
If snake touches any of the 4 sides or itself, the snake dies and the game is over.
